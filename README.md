# Flappy Bird

A simple Flappy Bird clone written in Python using Pygame.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12 or later
- `pygame` library

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Running the Game

```bash
python3 flappy.py
```

Press the **space** key to flap. Navigate the bird through the gaps in the pipes. Passing a set of pipes awards one point. Colliding with a pipe or the ground ends the game and displays your final score.
